# Toronto Trendspotter Architecture

This document outlines the system architecture for the Toronto Trendspotter recommendation engine.

## System Overview

Toronto Trendspotter is a machine learning-powered recommendation system that combines Pinterest-like visual content discovery with Toronto-specific local trends and interests. The system analyzes user behavior and content characteristics to deliver personalized, location-aware recommendations.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Layer

#### 1.1 Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores structured data including:
  - User profiles and preferences
  - Content metadata
  - User-content interactions
  - Toronto events information
  
- **MongoDB Database**: Stores more flexible, document-based data including:
  - Raw scraped content
  - Feature vectors for ML models
  - Unstructured content metadata

#### 1.2 Data Collection
- **Web Scrapers**: Python-based scrapers for collecting:
  - Pinterest-like content
  - Toronto event information
  - Local business data
  
- **API Integrations**:
  - Eventbrite API for Toronto events
  - Google Places API for local business data
  - Weather data for seasonal recommendations

### 2. Application Layer

#### 2.1 Data Processing
- **ETL Pipeline**: Extract, transform, load pipeline for data preparation
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates features for recommendation models
- **Geospatial Processing**: Handles location-based data for Toronto recommendations

#### 2.2 Machine Learning
- **Recommendation Models**:
  - Collaborative filtering for user-based recommendations
  - Content-based filtering for item similarity
  - Hybrid approach combining both methods
  - Toronto-specific boosting for local relevance
  
- **Model Training Pipeline**:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model training
  - Evaluation and validation
  - Model serialization

#### 2.3 A/B Testing Framework
- **Experiment Framework**: Infrastructure for testing different recommendation strategies
- **Variant Management**: Handles different recommendation algorithms
- **Metrics Collection**: Tracks performance of different approaches

### 3. API Layer

- **RESTful API**: FastAPI-based endpoints for:
  - User authentication
  - Content retrieval
  - Recommendation generation
  - Interaction logging

### 4. Presentation Layer

- **Frontend Application**:
  - React-based user interface
  - Pinterest-inspired content layout
  - Toronto-focused visual elements
  
- **Analytics Dashboard**:
  - Performance metrics visualization
  - Recommendation quality monitoring

## Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Content is collected from various sources and stored in the data layer
2. **Data Processing**: Raw data is processed, normalized, and transformed
3. **Feature Engineering**: Features are extracted for use in ML models
4. **Model Training**: Recommendation models are trained on processed data
5. **API Integration**: Models are exposed via API endpoints
6. **Frontend Display**: User interface presents recommendations to users
7. **Interaction Logging**: User interactions are recorded for model improvement
8. **Performance Analysis**: System metrics are monitored and analyzed

## Technology Stack

- **Data Processing**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Scraping**: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- **API Framework**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React.js, D3.js
- **Deployment**: Docker

## Scalability Considerations

- **Data Partitioning**: Sharding strategy for growing data volume
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed recommendations
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background workers for intensive tasks
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Containerized services for easy scaling
