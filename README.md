## A Machine Learning-Powered Local Content Discovery Platform

Toronto Trendspotter is an advanced recommendation engine that delivers personalized content discovery for Toronto's events, places, and experiences. By leveraging collaborative filtering, content-based analysis, and location-aware algorithms, the platform creates hyper-relevant recommendations tailored to individual preferences and local context.

### [Live Demo](https://trendspotter-v1.vercel.app/) | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shakeb03/TrendSpotterV1)

> **Note:** The current version uses a curated mock dataset. Integration with live data sources is in progress.

## Features

* **Personalized Recommendations**: Multi-model hybrid recommendation system that learns from user preferences, content similarity, and interaction patterns
* **Location-Aware Discovery**: Neighborhood-specific content recommendations that prioritize local relevance
* **Seasonal Adaptations**: Content suggestions that adapt based on Toronto's seasons and upcoming events
* **Interactive Map Exploration**: Visual discovery through an interactive neighborhood map
* **A/B Testing Framework**: Built-in experimentation platform to continuously optimize recommendations
* **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive design for seamless experience across devices

## Technical Architecture

### System Overview

Toronto Trendspotter implements a comprehensive recommendation engine using multiple algorithms that work together to provide highly relevant content suggestions.

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built on a Python foundation with FastAPI and organized in a modular architecture:

#### Recommendation Engine

The core of the system is a sophisticated hybrid recommendation engine that combines three distinct approaches:

1. **Collaborative Filtering (35%)**

   * Item-based approach that finds patterns across user interactions
   * Identifies content that users with similar preferences have enjoyed
   * Reduces cold start problems by leveraging collective wisdom

2. **Content-Based Filtering (30%)**

   * Analyzes content features (text, categories, visual elements)
   * Creates feature vectors for similarity calculations
   * Incorporates NLP for text understanding and feature extraction

3. **Location-Based Enhancements (25%)**

   * Toronto-specific location model for neighborhood relevance
   * Geospatial awareness for proximity recommendations
   * Neighborhood affinity modeling based on user preferences

4. **Temporal/Seasonal Adjustments (10%)**

   * Seasonal boosting for time-relevant content
   * Event proximity factoring based on dates
   * Trending content identification

The recommendation pipeline follows these stages:

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
2. **Feature Engineering & Extraction**
3. **User Profiling**
4. **Model Training & Hybridization**
5. **Content Ranking & Serving**
6. **Feedback Collection & Model Refinement**

#### Database Design

The system uses MongoDB Atlas for flexible document storage with the following collections:

* `users`: User profiles and preferences
* `content`: Content items (pins, events, places)
* `interactions`: User-content interaction tracking
* `toronto_events`: Toronto-specific event data
* `feature_vectors`: Computed feature vectors for ML models
* `ml_models`: Model metadata and parameters

#### API Layer

The recommendation API is built with FastAPI and provides endpoints for:

* User-specific recommendations
* Location-based content discovery
* Similar content retrieval
* Trending and popular content
* Interaction logging

### Frontend Architecture

The React frontend is built with TypeScript and organized using a component-based architecture:

* **Context Providers**: Global state management (user authentication, preferences)
* **Page Components**: Full page views for main application routes
* **Feature Components**: Reusable UI components for content display, search, maps
* **Service Layer**: API integration, data fetching, and client-side utilities
* **Utility Functions**: Formatting, data processing, and helper functions

#### Key Frontend Technologies

* **React & TypeScript**: Type-safe component development
* **React Router**: Application routing
* **React Query**: Data fetching, caching, and state management
* **Leaflet**: Interactive map integration
* **Recharts**: Data visualization for analytics
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

### ML Pipeline

The machine learning pipeline incorporates:

1. **Text Processing**: NLP techniques for content understanding
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extraction of relevant features from content
3. **Model Training**: Collaborative and content-based models
4. **Model Evaluation**: Metrics calculation and performance assessment
5. **Hybrid Blending**: Weighted combination of model outputs
6. **Location Enhancement**: Toronto-specific geographic boosting
7. **Seasonal Adjustment**: Time-based relevance scoring

### Deployment Architecture

* **Backend**: Hosted on Render with auto-scaling capabilities
* **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel for global CDN distribution
* **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based document storage
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
